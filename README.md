# A Stock Analysis

The purpose of the repository “stock-analysis” is to store the files used in preforming analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.  I will be using this README.md file to help Carleton people using my GitHub to understand what is here and where to find it.

## Files in the Stock Analysis Repository

I have created a resource folder to hold the image files that we be in the Challenge report.

- The Excel spreadsheet containing the required tab is labeled VBA_Challenges.xlsx

- There is another Excel Spreadsheet green_stocks.xlsx that was a reminent after renaming the .xlsm file as part of the challenge

- The imported original VBScript VBA_Challenge.vbs is also included here

- The final report is in the Markdown file Written_Report_Challenge2.md

- The repository contains a resource folder with the six figures that are referenced in the report

- A zip folder of the complete repository can also be found here
