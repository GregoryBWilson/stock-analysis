# A Stock Analysis

The purpose of the repository “stock-analysis” is to store the files used in preforming analysis on  data in the VBA_Challenge.xlsm (a macro enabled version of green_stocks.xlsx) spreadsheet to uncover trends.  I will be using this README.md file to help Carleton people using my GitHub to understand what is here and where to find everything.

## Files in the Stock Analysis Repository

I have created a resource folder to hold the image files that will be in the final report.

- The Excel spreadsheet containing the required tabs is labeled VBA_Challenges.xlsm
- There is another Excel Spreadsheet green_stocks.xlsx that was a remnant after renaming the .xlsm version of this file as part of the challenge
- The imported original VBScript VBA_Challenge.vbs is also included here for reference sake
- The final report can be found in the markdown file Written_Report_Challenge2.md
- This repository contains a resource folder "Resources" with the six figures and two tables that are referenced in the report
- A zip folder of the complete repository can also be found here in this repository

## Additional Files in the Stock Analysis Repository

Based on feedback from the grader I now know that I didn't know what the true objective of the project was.  Now with a clear understanding I revised the submission.  Here is what has been added

- The revised final report can be found in the markdown file Written_Report_Challenge2(revised).md
- The Excel spreadsheet containing the required tabs is labeled VBA_Challenges(revised).xlsm
- Six new screenshots capturing the message box for timer have also been added to the Resources folder.
